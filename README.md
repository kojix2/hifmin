This tool simply flips the text 180 degrees. However, it is very powerful for proofreading short texts posted on social media.

Many people instantly process text as an image. Recognize multiple words as a set. Then start reading the text carefully if necessary.

The visual trick of rotating text allows our brains to simulate how others perceive our posts. This allows you to create short sentences that are easy to understand.

The name of this tool comes from the famous shogi player Hifumi Kato's ``Hifumin Eye.'' This means looking into the board from your opponent's side during a shogi match.

All code for this tool was generated by ChatGPT.
